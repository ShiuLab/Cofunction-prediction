This subfolder contains the files Shinhan used to test script_feature_generation.py:
* test: a text file with two rows that can be used as input.
* test_err: a deliberately problematic file capture potential problems with input files.
* test.features_out: output based on the test input.
* test_check.xlsx: a spreadsheet with part of the test.features_out values for double checking correctness of the output.
